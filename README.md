# CLEO-Artificial-Neural-Network
CLEO Artificial Neural Network is a script that was mostly used in Artificial Intelligence system, neural network are their main brain activities, it can learn by itself thanks to backpropagation algorithm to help neural network learn if the output is incorrect

The code was originally written in python, but was converted into CLEO scripts version and yes, it really provide same output as in python
